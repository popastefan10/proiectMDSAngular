## Epic Story: 

Our social media application allows users to create accounts in order to create posts and share them with other people. Posts can have several pictures and anyone can express their thoughts by writing comments or giving likes. We also plan on adding debate and video calling features depending on how time allows us.

## User Stories:

### Must-Have

1. As a user, I want to be able to post pictures on my profile and see other people's pictures as well.
2. As a user, I must have a login form in order to enter my account.
3. As a user, I must have a signup form in order to create an account.
4. As a user, I want to be able to send text messages to other users.
5. As a user, I want to be able to comment and leave reactions on other people's posts.
6. As a user, I want to be able to enter a separate chat room if I want to thoroughly debate a hot topic brought by other users in a comment or post.
7. As a user, I want to be able to allow only certain people to see my posts or send me messages.
8. As a user, I want to be able to search other people's names and connect with them.
9. As a user, I want to be able to follow certain profiles and see the content they post on my front page.

### Nice-to-have

10. As a business-owner, I want to be able to see how many people viewed my profile over time.
11. As a user, I want to be able to make serverless video calls.
12. As a user, I want to get content recommendations based on posts I liked previously.
13. As a user, I want to get notifications.
